# Indie-Game


This is a repository that I will be using to store my progress in my indie game development journey, the only game I have any progress
on currently is "Escape From Algorift". Since this is my first game I decided to partially model it off of Space Invaders to get the 
mechanics of the PyGame module and game development down, I am currently in the process of turning this game into something 
completely different than just a Space Invaders "knock off" and I am thoroughly excited to share my progress as I continue to work on this
project.
